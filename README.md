##Abstract: Post-translational modification is responsible for a variety of activities such as protein building, protein stability, etc. Among all PTMs, ubiquitination plays a key role in cell life cycle activities such as proteasomal degradation, transcriptional regulation, and restoration of DNA damage. It also includes many cellular processes and for the detection of a variety of diseases. Because of all these advantages, it is important to identify the molecular mechanism of ubiquitination sites. In this study we have used statistical moment for feature extraction and random forest for classification. Three datasets are used in this research for the training and testing of the model. For the evaluation 10 fold cross-validation, Self-consistency and Jack-Knife cross validation are performed to evaluate UbiSites performance, using precision measurements. The 10-Fold cross validation, self-consistency and Jackknife testing are used for model evaluations; we obtained accuracy of 100% for the dataset-1, 99.91% for the dataset-2 and 99.91% for the dataset-3. The model achieved almost the maximum results which are far better as compared to the already existing models, available in the literature.
